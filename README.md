# Desciption
The main purpose of the data we want to provide is to analyze the factors that may exist in the US states that affect the vaccination rate. The designed data includes the vaccination rate of each state, daily cases, (education level, and median salary). Also, our data can enhance public health workforce programs to help the U.S. better respond to the outbreak in terms of the necessary steps to increase vaccination rates, which can slow down the spread of Covid. Our vision with our data dashboard will hopefully allow us to provide informative information through numbers and statistics of Covid cases and vaccination rates. In terms of the potential stakeholders who may be interested in our subject and data, data companies as well as medical companies may potentially be interested in using and collecting our data to include into their databases. For the interested medical companies, they may potentially be bringing in accurate data that monitors and records the health of each of their patients. They can also track how many of their patients have Covid as well as vaccination records of their patients. For the interested data companies, they may potentially be bringing in accurate and large quantities of data that can expand on their numbers and visualizations. At the end of the day, we hope that our data can identify some of the factors that may contribute to low vaccination rates, so that states with low vaccination rates can refer to the corresponding measures to improve vaccination rates., and all these efforts are to help the United States better cope with the Covid-19 outbreak.

# Project Plan
In terms of our planning process for our data dashboard, we want to import data that is from the main database source instead of summarized data from a database. The number of coronavirus cases per state in the U.S. can be tracked by Worldometer, a  reference website that provides counters and real-time statistics for diverse topics including Covid-19. The data is updated daily. The vaccination rates of each state in the U.S. can be tracked by the CDC, the national public health agency of the United States. The data by the CDC shows complete vaccination rates, partial vaccination rates, as well as the rates of people receiving Covid booster shots. The data is updated weekly. We are planning on using these two data sources. Specifically, the data that we want to present on our dashboard will summarize the raw data and show how vaccination rates of each state in the U.S. correlate with the number of coronavirus cases in each state. In terms of the actual design of the data dashboard, we want to create visualizations that show the raw data of our original data sources, vaccination rates of each state, correlation of vaccination rates and covid cases, as well as a visual of our final statement and conclusion. We are planning on using simple colors and aesthetics that are visually appealing to the viewer. For example, we want to use only a couple of consistent colors for our visuals and we want to use simple bar graphs and scatter plots to visualize our data. Before creating these visualizations, we are planning to put all of the data together in a spreadsheet to summarize and get rid of unnecessary data. 


# Data Biography
This data set is collected by the CDC through cooperation with the US Public Health Surveillance System and the US state medical systems to collect specific data on Covid vaccination rates in each state of the country. According to the website, this data source “represents all vaccine partners including jurisdictional partner clinics, retail pharmacies, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Health Resources and Services Administration partner sites, and federal entity facilities.”(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2021) This dataset collects the proportion of people who were vaccinated more than one dose, were fully vaccinated, and were vaccinated with booster doses in every age group in each state in the United States. In addition, the data set also collects different attitudes and experiences of Covid vaccination by age group in various states of the United States, and daily cases by state in the U.S. CDC conducts a complete analysis and estimation of the data as a whole by collecting and integrating the data collected from various state organizations.

After collecting data, CDC uses interactive maps, trend lines, bar charts and data tables to monitor COVID-19 vaccination rates and confidence in vaccination in adults and children, which help CDC itself assess the extent of local, state and national protection against vaccine-preventable diseases and improve how the United States responds to the greatest public health threat (CDC, 2021). This data source can strengthen the U.S. basic surveillance system, build data science capabilities, and enhance public health workforce programs to help the U.S. better respond to the outbreak.

However, vaccination data from this data source typically has a lag time from the vaccination data displayed on the state website due to different lag times in each state (CDC, 2021). Not only that, because CDC does not receive personally identifiable information about vaccine doses, a person's first, second, and booster doses cannot be linked together, leading to an overestimation of the first dose and underestimation of subsequent doses during the analysis (CDC, 2021). 

This data source provides options to view footnotes and download the data table, which you can click the "View Historic Vaccination Data", "Data Table for COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States", and "Footnotes" button at the bottom of the website to view and download the related data information. In order to know more about the Covid data, you can click the “Dialysis Vaccination Data Dashboard”, “Nursing Home Vaccination Data Dashboard”, and “Want to know more about trends in COVID-19 US vaccinations?” button to find out more information you need, or find the tab you are interested in in the list on the left side of the page (CDC, 2021).

Another dataset we have considered using is titled “COVID-19 State Profile Report – Washington.” This dataset overviews the Covid-19 statistics in Washington including vaccination rates among various age groups, hospitalization rates, deaths, and case numbers. This data is updated weekly. This Covid-19 data is also compared to the rest of the United States (White House COVID-19 Team, 2021). 

The dataset contains different graphic and mapping depictions to display different Covid-19 data. This data is represented down to a county level (White House COVID-19 Team, 2021).

# Expected Outcomes
We look forward to comparing different data to find possible reasons for the high and low vaccination rates in each state. For example, whether there is a large gap in the proportion of vaccinations among different age groups? If so, which age group is more inclined to not be vaccinated. Or, do the different daily cases by state affect vaccination rates? If so, are the states with high daily cases high on the vaccination rates, or are the states with low daily cases high on the vaccination rates? In addition, we can also compare the state's vaccination rate with the state's education level or average income to find the relationship between these data. The ultimate goal is to find any factors that may affect vaccination rates to help state medical institutions better plan to achieve higher vaccination rates across the United States.
