<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This R Markdown document demonstrates our abilities to use models for
data analysis using a data set collected on Covid-19 vaccination rates,
cases, and some data related to them.</p>
<h2>Covid-19 Vaccination Rates and Cases{.tabset}</h2>
<p>In this report, we examine the relationship between vaccine coverage
and confirmed cases in US states. And further compare the vaccine
coverage rate and the education level or average income of each state to
try to figure out the reasons that may affect the vaccine coverage rate.
<code>{r load data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE} vac_base &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Vaccination_Base.csv&quot;, row.names=NULL) #vac_rates &lt;- vac_base$Admin_Per_100K #vac_rates &lt;- cbind(vac_base$Location, vac_base$Admin_Per_100K) rate_cases &lt;- vac_base %&gt;%    select(State_Abbreviations, Location, Admin_Per_100K, Per_Cases) %&gt;%   arrange(desc(Admin_Per_100K)) rate_education &lt;- vac_base %&gt;%    select(State_Abbreviations, Location, Admin_Per_100K, Percent_High_School_Or_Higher, Percent_Bachel_Or_Higher) %&gt;%   arrange(desc(Percent_High_School_Or_Higher), desc(Percent_Bachel_Or_Higher)) rate_income &lt;- vac_base %&gt;%    select(State_Abbreviations, Location, Admin_Per_100K, Household_Income) %&gt;%   arrange(desc(Household_Income))</code></p>
<h3>U.S. Covid-19 Vaccination Rates of Each States</h3>
<p>In this map, we shows the Covid-19 vaccination rates of each states,
and weight the color by using the Admin<em>Per</em>100K value.
Amdin<em>Per</em>100K value shows the total number of doses administered
per 100,000 census population based on the jurisdiction where recipient
lives.</p>
<p>```{r ratemap, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE} usa &lt;-

<p>ggplotly(g) ```</p>
<h3>U.S. Covid-19 Cases Rates of Each States</h3>
<p>In this map, we shows the Covid-19 cases rates of each states, and
weight the color by using the Per<em>Cases value. Per</em>Cases value
shows Shows the state&#39;s confirmed cases as a percentage of the state&#39;s
total population.</p>
<p>```{r casemap, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE} g &lt;- ggplot(data =
usa<em>fb) + geom</em>sf(aes(fill = Per<em>Cases)) +
scale</em>fill<em>viridis</em>c(option = &quot;A&quot;, direction = -1)</p>
<p>ggplotly(g) ```</p>
<h3>Vaccination Rates vs Covid-19 Cases Rates</h3>
<p>In this scatter plot, we shows the relationship between the
vaccination rates and cases rates of each states, and weight the color
by the the Admin<em>Per</em>100K. We can see from the graph that the
vaccination rates and the cases rates of each states are likely to be in
a linear relationship, which means for most of the states, states with a
smaller proportion of confirmed cases of the population generally have a
higher proportion of vaccination rates.</p>
<p>```{r scatterplot, echo = FALSE} g &lt;- ggplot(data = rate<em>cases,

(Per 100K)&quot;)</p>
<p>ggplotly(g) ```</p>
<h3>The Highest 5 and the lowest 5 Vaccination Rates States</h3>
<p>In these two bar graphs, we shows the 5 states who have the highest
vaccination rates, and 5 states who have the lowest vaccination
rates.From these two graphs, we can see that the disparity in
vaccination rates from state to state is still very large. Which means
we need to make more efforts in states with low vaccination rates to
increase vaccination rates across the country so that we can better
respond to the outbreak.</p>

<h2>Covid-19 Vaccination Rates and Educational Level{.tabset}</h2>
<p>This section analyzes the rate of Covid-19 vaccination versus the
education level in individual states. It also examines total education
rates in each state.</p>
<h3>Educational Level of Each U.S. State</h3>
<p>These maps display both the percentage of people who have a high
school education or higher and a bachelor&#39;s degree or higher. ```{r

<h3>Vaccination Rates vs Educational Level</h3>

<h2>Household Income of Each U.S. State{.tabset}</h2>
<p>In this section, we analyze how the median household income of each
U.S. State has an impact on the vaccination rates of each U.S.
State.</p>
<h3>Household Income of Each U.S. State</h3>
<p>In this map, we shows the median household income of each states, and
weight the color by using the Household_Income value.</p>
<p>```{r incomemap, echo = FALSE} usa<em>fb &lt;- usa</em>sf() %&gt;%

<h3>Vaccination Rates vs Household Income</h3>
<p>This scatter plot compares the median household income of each U.S.
State with the vaccination rates of each state. The purpose is to show
if the household income of a state has an affect on the vaccination rate
of a state.</p>
<p>```{r scatterplot<em>income, echo=FALSE} g &lt;- ggplot(data =

<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Data Biography</h2>
<p>This data set is collected by the CDC through cooperation with the US
Public Health Surveillance System and the US state medical systems to
collect specific data on Covid vaccination rates in each state of the
country. According to the website, this data source “represents all
vaccine partners including jurisdictional partner clinics, retail
pharmacies, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers, Federal
Emergency Management Agency and Health Resources and Services
Administration partner sites, and federal entity facilities.”(Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2021) This dataset collects
the proportion of people who were vaccinated more than one dose, were
fully vaccinated, and were vaccinated with booster doses in every age
group in each state in the United States. In addition, the data set also
collects different attitudes and experiences of Covid vaccination by age
group in various states of the United States, and daily cases by state
in the U.S. CDC conducts a complete analysis and estimation of the data
as a whole by collecting and integrating the data collected from various
state organizations.</p>
<p>After collecting data, CDC uses interactive maps, trend lines, bar
charts and data tables to monitor COVID-19 vaccination rates and
confidence in vaccination in adults and children, which help CDC itself
assess the extent of local, state and national protection against
vaccine-preventable diseases and improve how the United States responds
to the greatest public health threat (CDC, 2021). This data source can
strengthen the U.S. basic surveillance system, build data science
capabilities, and enhance public health workforce programs to help the
U.S. better respond to the outbreak.</p>
<p>However, vaccination data from this data source typically has a lag
time from the vaccination data displayed on the state website due to
different lag times in each state (CDC, 2021). Not only that, because
CDC does not receive personally identifiable information about vaccine
doses, a person&#39;s first, second, and booster doses cannot be linked
together, leading to an overestimation of the first dose and
underestimation of subsequent doses during the analysis (CDC, 2021).</p>
<p>This data source provides options to view footnotes and download the
data table, which you can click the &quot;View Historic Vaccination Data&quot;,
&quot;Data Table for COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States&quot;, and
&quot;Footnotes&quot; button at the bottom of the website to view and download the
related data information. In order to know more about the Covid data,
you can click the “Dialysis Vaccination Data Dashboard”, “Nursing Home
Vaccination Data Dashboard”, and “Want to know more about trends in
COVID-19 US vaccinations?” button to find out more information you need,
or find the tab you are interested in in the list on the left side of
the page (CDC, 2021).</p>
<p>Another dataset we have considered using is titled “COVID-19 State
Profile Report – Washington.” This dataset overviews the Covid-19
statistics in Washington including vaccination rates among various age
groups, hospitalization rates, deaths, and case numbers. This data is
updated weekly. This Covid-19 data is also compared to the rest of the
United States (White House COVID-19 Team, 2021).</p>
<p>The dataset contains different graphic and mapping depictions to
display different Covid-19 data. This data is represented down to a
county level (White House COVID-19 Team, 2021).</p>
